very similiar to c from first year;
when printing variables, gotta %d, %s, %f

lists;
add things to lists with append:

mylist = []

mylist.append(1)

mylist.append(2) ...


Accessing an index which does not exist generates an exception (an error).
mylist = [1,2,3]

print(mylist[10]) .... not in range error
